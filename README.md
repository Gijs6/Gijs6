# Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Gijs, also known as _gijsz_ and _Gijs6_ online.

I'm always working on many diffrent projects, both by myself and together with my friends [Robin](https://github.com/RobinBoers) and [PotSjem](https://github.com/not-msb) as part of [{du}punkto](https://dupunkto.org), our small programming collective.

I've only been active here since around December 2024 (_before that, I just didn't really use git, I have no idea how..._), but I've been coding for about three to four years now.

Feel free to reach out to me via email at [gijs6@dupunkto.org](mailto:gijs6@dupunkto.org)!

Have fun exploring this place! ðŸš€
