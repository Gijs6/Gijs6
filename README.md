# Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Gijs, also known as _gijsz_ and _Gijs6_ online.

I'm currently working on [*Meliag*](https://github.com/Gijs6/Meliag) (a website designed to display train data in a nice way), [*GSS*](https://github.com/Gijs6/GSS) (a tool to make your CSS nicer) and my [personal website](https://www.gijs6.nl/).

I've only been active here since around December 2024 (_before that, I just didn't really use git, I have no idea how..._), but I've been coding for about two years now.

Sometimes, I also work on projects related to the Somtoday API (which is a bit of huge a mess), like [SomPlus](https://github.com/Gijs6/SomPlus).

Feel free to reach out to me via email at [gijs6@dupunkto.org](mailto:gijs6@dupunkto.org)!

Have fun exploring this wonderful place! ðŸš€
