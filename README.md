# Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Gijs, also known as _gijsz_ and _Gijs6_ online.  
I mainly build things on the web, but sometimes other things, so just take a look around my profile :D  

I've only been active here since around December 2024 (_before that, I just didn't really use git, I have no idea how..._), but I've been coding for about three to four years now.

Feel free to reach out to me via email!

Have a nice day :D
